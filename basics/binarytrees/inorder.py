# InOrder traversal
# For traversing a (non-empty) binary tree in an inorder fashion, we must do these three things for every node n starting from the treeâ€™s root:
# (L) Recursively traverse its left subtree. When this step is finished, we are back at n again.
# (N) Process n itself.
# (R) Recursively traverse its right subtree. When this step is finished, we are back at n again.
